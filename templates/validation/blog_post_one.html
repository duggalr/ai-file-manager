            The purpose of this blog is to document the development journey of File Companion from the ground up. 
            As we build this project, we aim to share our insights, highlight both the technical and non-technical challenges we encounter, 
            and provide a glimpse into the problems we're tackling next.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4 mt-10">The Problem We’re Addressing</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            For this first post, we’ll provide some context about the problem we’re addressing and why we decided to work on File Companion.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            We live in an age of information overload. With an immense amount of data at our fingertips, keeping it organized, up-to-date, 
            and easily retrievable has become increasingly challenging. While Google and various AI startups are doing great work organizing 
            information on the web, there remains a significant gap in tools that help individuals manage their personal information—whether that’s 
            files, cloud drives, bookmarks, or physical notes. Our goal with File Companion is to address this gap, beginning with a focus on personal file management.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4 mt-10">Our Vision for File Companion</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            The vision for File Companion is to work seamlessly in the background as a desktop application, automatically organizing your files in a meaningful way.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            For our first version, which we’re currently hard at work on, the AI will analyze the content of each file and categorize it based on the semantic entities it detects. 
            The result is an organized system that makes your data easy to view and manage. Additionally, the application will feature a powerful semantic search function, accessible 
            via a keyboard shortcut, allowing you to quickly find and open the information you need, whenever you need it.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4 mt-10">Security and Privacy</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            From the outset, we’ve placed a strong emphasis on security and data privacy. <strong>Your file data will never be stored on our servers or in our database.</strong> Instead, it’s processed 
            in memory and transmitted to our hosted LLM in an encrypted format, where it’s immediately deleted after processing. We only store very preliminary metadata about your files, 
            along with the categorization data generated by the LLM.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4 mt-10">What’s Next</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
            In the coming blog posts, we’ll dive deeper into the technical details of the project and highlight the challenges we’ve faced—and those we anticipate—as we continue building out the application.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
